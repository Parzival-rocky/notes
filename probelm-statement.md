# Problem statement

## Input: 

### Dataset
- meteorological data using RAMS
- tracer concentration data using HYSPLIT
- environmental parameteres captured at 6min intervals over a 6-hour simulation window

The simulation dataset consists:
- 1 timing variable (time)
- 2 location variables (latitude and longitude)
- 12 meeorological parameters
    1. temperature 
    2. relative humidity 
    3. pressure 
    4. water vapor 
    5. turbulent kinetic energy 
    6. precipitatoin rate 
    7. sensible heat flux 
    8. latent heat flux 
    9. west to east wind velocity 
    10. sout to north wind velocity 
    11. vertical wind velocity 
    12. tracer concentration

Definitions: 
- The dataset uses the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) for weather forecasting and airborne dispersion model to simulate toxic releases
- A Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) is used to predict the tracer concentrations at various locations.


## Output

### Regression model
For predicting methane concentration

### Classification model
For detecting methane concentration

A predictive model will be developed to suggest optimal drone naviagation
- based on real data and 
- based on historical  mehane data

## Process

### Data processing
If tracer concentration > 0: 
- methane leakage
Else tracer concentration = 0: 
- no methane leakage

Balancing the dataset:
- clean data so that you have equal amount of data with tracer concentration and no tracer concentration
    
Removing irrelevant parameters:
- they removed the timing and location variables from the dataset, as the ml should only depend  on the meteorological parameteres
- because precipitation rate has constant value of zero it was removed from the dataset

Adding relevant parameters:
- added a boolean for leakage
    - 1 if tracer concentration > 0
    - 0 if tracer concentration = 0

Tuning hyperparameter

### Machine learning model training
Classification model
- remove tracer concentration from the dataset
- use the boolean parameter instead

Regression model:
- for regression model only work at dataset with tracer concentration > 0 ,
    - use tracer concentration as target variable
    - the meteorological data as input feature


# A much more lean problem statement 

Input: 
- meteorological data generated by RAM 
- methane concentration data using HYSPLIT

Process: 
- use a binary classification model to detect the presence or absense of methane leak 
    - leak present: if methane concentration > 0 
    - leak absent: if methane conceentration = 0
- once leak is detected! use a regression model to predict the methane concentration level using the same meteorological data

Output: 
- classification model: outputs methane detection (boolean Yes/No) 
- regression model: predicts methane concentration intensity (integer value)
